# Forecast Generation

Our signals are generated by obtaining raw carry values, annualizing the carry, smoothing the carry over different exponentially weighted moving averages, and then, finally, scaling and capping the forecast.

Raw carry is defined as either:

\\ Raw Carry = Price of Nearer Futures Contract - Pirce of Further Out Contract\\

or 

\\Raw Carry = Price of Currently Held Contract - Price of Further Out Contract\\



Our raw forecast of a single window is given by the following formula:

\\[ f_t = \Annualized Carry {\sigma_{p}x16} \\]
