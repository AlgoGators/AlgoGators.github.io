# Forecast Generation

Our signals are generated by obtaining raw carry values, annualizing the carry, smoothing the carry over different exponentially weighted moving averages, and then, finally, scaling and capping the forecast.

## Measuring Expected Carry

Raw carry is defined as either:

\\[\text{Raw Carry} = \text{Price of Nearer Futures Contract} - \text{Price of Further Out Contract}\\]

\\[\text{Raw Carry} = \text{Price of Currently Held Contract} - \text{Price of Further Out Contract}\\]

## Annualization

Annualized carry reflects what we can expect to earn between expiries. Some contracts trade quarterly, other monthly; and even some that roll usually two but sometimes three months apart. We must annualize to get a consistent estimate of carry.

\\[\text{Expiry Difference in Years = \text{|Months between Contracts|\div 12}}\\ ]


Our raw forecast of a single window is given by the following formula:

\\[ \text{Carry} = \frac{\text{Annualized Carry}}{\sigma_{p} \times 16} \\]
