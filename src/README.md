# The AlgoGators Book
This book serves to document the AlgoGators Investment Fund's systems and processes. The AlgoGators were started in the Fall of 2023 at the University of Florida in hopes of bringing together a diverse group of students interested in Quantitative Finance and Algorithmic Trading Strategies. The group's novel and ambitious goal represent the its desire to stay on the cutting edge of quantitative finance within an academic and pratical setting.

The Fund relies on a variety of tools and technologies to implement its strategies. The book will cover the following: `Python`, `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Scipy`, `Matplotlib`, `Databento`, `SQL`, and `SqlAlchemy`. The book is divided into the following sections:
